# Reconciliator

Checking if data reconciles, using this algorithm, is a matter of reading the **truth** data and the **current** data.
You can use any input specification compatible with the lakehouse engine to read **truth** or **current** data. On top
of that, you can pass a `truth_preprocess_query` and a `current_preprocess_query` so you can preprocess the data before
it goes into the actual reconciliation process. The reconciliation process is focused on joining **truth**
with `current` by all provided columns except the ones passed as `metrics`.

In the table below, we present how a simple reconciliation would look like:

| current_country | current_count | truth_country | truth_count | absolute_diff | perc_diff | yellow | red | recon_type |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|-----------|--------|-----|------------|
| Sweden          | 123           | Sweden        | 120         | 3             | 0.025     | 0.1    | 0.2 | percentage |
| Germany         | 2946          | Sweden        | 2946        | 0             | 0         | 0.1    | 0.2 | percentage |
| France          | 2901          | France        | 2901        | 0             | 0         | 0.1    | 0.2 | percentage |
| Belgium         | 426           | Belgium       | 425         | 1             | 0.002     | 0.1    | 0.2 | percentage |

The Reconciliator algorithm uses an ACON to configure its execution. You can find the meaning of each ACON property
in [ReconciliatorSpec object](../../reference/packages/core/definitions.md#packages.core.definitions.ReconciliatorSpec).

Below there is an example of usage of reconciliator.
```python
