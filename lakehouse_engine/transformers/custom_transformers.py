        This transformer can be very useful whenever the user cannot use our provided

        .. warning:: Attention!
            Please bear in mind that the custom_transformer function provided
            as argument needs to receive a DataFrame and return a DataFrame,
            because it is how Spark's .transform method is able to chain the
            transformations.

        Example:
        ```python
        def my_custom_logic(df: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
        ```

        Args:
            custom_transformer: custom transformer function. A python function with all
                required pyspark logic provided by the user.

        Returns:
            Callable: the same function provided as parameter, in order to e called
                later in the TransformerFactory.

        lakehouse engine transformers.

        Args:
            sql: the SQL query to be executed. This can read from any table or
                view from the catalog, or any dataframe registered as a temp
                view.
